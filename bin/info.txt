What makes a valid move?
------------------------
the piece can logically move that way
there are no pieces in between
the end piece either has a capturable piece, your piece, nothing

Capture pieces

if piece is capturable (parm piece, piece color) //check if square is empty: return false
-capture piece
else move piece

King Checks
Interate through 2d array and see what pieces are there
Figure out what piece and detect possible moves. If one of those moves (of other color) is attacking the king, return true
else return false when the board is interated through and no checks on the king.

Create a 2d array of spots white/ black pieces take up

rewrite to have method to check a gamebaord for check

Getting out of checkmate:
1. move out
2. king capture out
3. Your piece can capture the piece checking your king
4. Your piece can block
