What makes a valid move?
------------------------
the piece can logically move that way
there are no pieces in between
the end piece either has a capturable piece, your piece, nothing

Capture pieces

if piece is capturable (parm piece, piece color) //check if square is empty: return false
-capture piece
else move piece

King Checks
Interate through 2d array and see what pieces are there
Figure out what piece and detect possible moves. If one of those moves (of other color) is attacking the king, return true
else return false when the board is interated through and no checks on the king.

Create a 2d array of spots white/ black pieces take up

Check:
rewrite to have method to check a gamebaord for check

Getting out of checkmate:
1. move out
2. king capture out
3. Your piece can capture the piece checking your king
4. Your piece can block

Check for check
    if king in check
        check for mate
            1.King can move : false (not mate)
            2.Piece can block
                Create new gameBoard and copy from og gameBoard
                Go through each piece possible moves
                if one piece can block and checkmate is false: return false (recursion)
            3. Piece can capture attacking piece
                Similar to piece can block 
                Same method as piece can block but checking for piece Captures
                If the piece that is detecting finds a row and col that the checking piece is on, return false
When piece is moving, under valid moves check if the piece is moving into check. if the piece is moving into check return false for valid moves
    Before confirming if its a valid move make a new instance of gameBoard 
    Copy current gameBoard to new gameBoard and make the move
    Check if there is a check
    If there is return false for valid moves

Checking for stalemate
    1. Make move
    2. If no check, check for stalemate 
        Can the king move?
        If no can a piece move? The piece moving could lead to check, therefore a staelemate
